 During Assignment 002, in the MainActivity.java, I change the DownloadUpdate class to update my location, then create the TemUpdate class to update the temperature.
 
 Weather api i used:"https://www.sojson.com/open/api/weather/json.shtml?city="+address,such as https://www.sojson.com/open/api/weather/json.shtml?city=重庆, which returns json data;
 
 Ip api I used: http://ip.chinaz.com/getip.aspx
 
 And then create the isNetworkAvalible and checkNetwork function to check whether the network is ok;
